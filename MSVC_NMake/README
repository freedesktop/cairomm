Building cairomm with Visual Studio .NET 2015 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2015 (MSVC 14.0) or later.  Building with Visual Studio 2015 or earlier is no longer
  supported.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/ and add
  the paths to headers and import libraries to Visual Studio, if they are not already in
  $(srcroot)/../vs$(VSVER)/$(Platform).
* It is recommended (and possibly required) that you build cairomm and software that depends on cairomm with the
  same compiler, even though Microsoft tried hard to make things API and ABI compatible between Visual Studio
  2015, 2017 and 2019, so the build distinguishes between these versions with 'vc140' (2015), 'vc141' (2017) and
  'vc142' (2019) in the output DLL and .lib filenames, as per the toolset version as Microsoft defined.  If using
  'vc140' in the DLL and .lib names are desired (such as when rebuilding software that depends on cairomm is
  not convenient), pass in 'USE_COMPAT_LIBS=1' in your NMake command line (note that doing this is not recommended).
* In a Visual Studio command prompt, go to $(srcroot)\MSVC_NMake
* Build using nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[release|debug].
* Run the tests
* If it is inconvenient for you to re-build any software using
  cairomm, you may need to pass in BUILD_COMPAT_LIB in your
  NMake command line so that your application will continue to
  run properly.
